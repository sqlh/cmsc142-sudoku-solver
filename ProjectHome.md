This is a project to be submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements in CMSC 142 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms in the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os. This project solves generic SuDoku puzzles and finds SuDokuX solutions and SuDokuY solutions for odd-numbered dimensions. This is done by backtracking.

An additional feature of this project is to generate a SuDoku puzzle using the minimum number of clues.
